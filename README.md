The pKernel
===========

The pKernel began as my Master's Thesis.  It's a fairly platform-
independent system for real-time manipulation and transformation of music.

It has its own scripting language, although it is deliberately very
low-level -- in fact it's a musical version of 6502 assembler.  The reason
for this is so that higher-level tools can be written to "compile" down
to this assembly language.  A full description of the assembler opcodes
can be found in the *byteCodes* file, and there are numerous examples
in the 'scores' directory.

I have been resurrecting this code recently, and I'll be freshening it
up over the next short while.  There is also some disused windows code that
builds the pKernel under windows and presents a very simple UI.  I currently
have no way to try to get it to work as I haven't used a windows machine
in almost a decade.

I'm also interested in connecting it with the

[Humdrum Toolkit](http://www.musiccog.ohio-state.edu/Humdrum/)

which is a project that I was heavily involved in during its development
in the mid 90s.

Feel free to contribute/ask/play!
